// {
//   query: "Hello, I'm working on some family law cases and need to look into recent judgments in India concerning family law, particularly those involving property rights and custody issues. Can you help?",
//   answer: "Absolutely, I can help with that. Let’s begin with property rights. One significant case is Sheela KK vs N G Suresh from 2020, where the Kerala High Court ruled that a divorced wife can claim property endowed to her husband without any limitation period, as per the Limitation Act, 1963. The trust between the spouses concerning property doesn't get extinguished even after the dissolution of marriage."

// {
//   query: "That's an intriguing case. It sets a substantial precedent regarding property rights post-divorce. What about the rights of daughters in ancestral property?",
//   answer: "India saw major amendments in the Hindu Succession Act, 1956, to include daughters as coparceners by birth, just like sons, through an amendment in 2005. This was further solidified by a few Supreme Court judgments. In Vineeta Sharma vs Rakesh Sharma (2020), the Supreme Court held that a daughter’s right over ancestral property does not depend on whether her father was alive at the time of the 2005 amendment"

This case involved international elements as the child was born in the US, and the mother had to move back to India due to the restraint order. She sought custody after the child was left with the paternal grandparents in Gwalior, India"

//   query: "Can you show me all the case law related to the same in the Supreme Court between 2021 and 2023?",
//   analysis: "Between 2021 and 2023, India's Supreme Court saw several notable family law cases. Key decisions included the dismissal of enhanced maintenance in Shipli Lenkar v. Susanta Kumar Lenkar & Anr (2023), emphasizing non-negotiable child rights in PSV v. Indian School & Anr (2023), and defining family for pension claims in Shri Ram Shridhar Chimurkar v.

Varun Sreenivasan (2023) and other cases in 2023 marked significant shifts in divorce law, including recognizing 'Irreconcilable Differences' as a ground for divorce.",
